# Save-photos-to-database

In this project i create a simple register form with 2 input field of type text for name and family and an input field of type file to get user picture.
In the controller The file type is checked and if it was a photo then the file size is checked and if the file size is less than 500 KB the 
photo is set as user photo and stored in the database.

I used spring framework, jpa, maven and mysql to implement project requirements
